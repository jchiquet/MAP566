## Course description {.unnumbered}

The objective of this course is to show students how statistics is used in practice to answer a specific question, by introducing a series of important model-based approaches.

The students will learn to select and use appropriate statistical methodologies and acquire solid and practical skills by working-out examples on real-world data sets from various areas including medicine, genomics, ecology, and others.

All analyses will be conducted mainly with the R software No strong knowledge neither of R is required (only basic scripting). You can find help easily on the web.

## Important remark {.unnumbered}

Much of the material used in this course is due to [Marc Lavielle](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lavielle/), who was the first to set up the course. We only have made some adjustments to it.
