## Course description

The objective of this course is to show students how statistics is used in practice to answer a specific question, by introducing a series of important model-based approaches.

The students will learn to select and use appropriate statistical methodologies and acquire solid and practical skills by working-out examples on real-world data sets from various areas including medicine, genomics, ecology, and others.

All analyses will be conducted with the R software, possibly with interfacing to Python. No strong knwoledge neither of R or Python programming is required (only basic scripting).
