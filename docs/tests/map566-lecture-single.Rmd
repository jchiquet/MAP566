### Preliminary {.unnumbered}

Only functions from `R`-base and stats (preloaded) are required plus packages from the **tidyverse** for data representation and manipulation.

```{r tests-config, message = FALSE}
#| code-fold: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)  # extend some ggplot2 features
library(pwr)        # power study in R
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

# Introduction

A feeding study served to authorize the MON863 maize, a genetically modified organism (GMO) developed by the Monsanto company,  by the European and American authorities. It included male and female rats. For each sex, one group was fed with GMOs in the equilibrated diet, and one with the closest control regimen without GMOs.

We are interested in the weight of the rats after a period of 14 weeks. 

```{r}
rat_weight <- read_csv("../../data/ratWeight.csv") %>% filter(week == 14) %>% select(-week)
rat_weight %>% rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

The data per gender and regime is displayed  below  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
#| code-fold: true
rat_weight %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(x = gender, y = weight) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = regime)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +  ylab("weight (g)")
```

The following table provides the mean weight in each group

```{r, message = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
rat_weight %>% group_by(regime, gender) %>% 
  summarise('average weight' = mean(weight), count = n()) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

Our main objective is to detect some possible effect of the diet on the weight. More precisely, we would like to know  if the differences observed in the data are due to random fluctuations in sampling or to differences in diet.

# Student's t-test

## One sample t-test

Before considering the problem of comparing two groups, let us start looking at the weight of the male rats only: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
#| code-fold: true
rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(x = regime, y = weight) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = regime)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +  ylab("weight (g)")
```

Let $x_1, x_2, x_n$ the weights of the $n$ male rats. We will assume that the $x_i$'s are independent and normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$:

$$ x_i \sim^{\mathrm{iid}} \mathcal{N}(\mu \ , \ \sigma^2)$$

### One sided test

We want to test 

$$H_0: \ ``\mu \leq \mu_0" \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \ ``\mu > \mu_0" $$

Function `t.test` can be used for performing this test:

```{r}
x <- rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% pull("weight")
mu0 <- 500
t.test(x, alternative="greater", mu=mu0)
```

Let us see what these outputs are and how they are computed.

Let $\bar{x} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ be the empirical mean of  the data.
$$ \bar{x} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu \ , \ \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$$
Then, 
$$ \begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt{n}(\bar{x} - \mu)}{\sigma} \ &   \sim \ \mathcal{N}(0 \ , \ 1) \\ 
\frac{\sqrt{n}(\bar{x} - \mu)}{s} \ &   \sim  \ t_{n-1} 
\end{aligned} $$

where 
$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 $$
is the empirical variance of the $x_i$'s.

The statistic used for the test should be a function of the data whose distribution under $H_0$  is known, and whose expected behavior under $H_1$ allows one to define a *rejection region* (or *critical region*) for the null hypothesis.

Here, the test statistic is
$$
T_{\rm stat} = \frac{(\bar{x} - \mu_0)}{s/\sqrt{n}}  $$
which follows a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom when $\mu=\mu_0$.

$\bar{x}$ is expected to be less than or equal to $\mu_0$ under the null hypothesis, and greater than $\mu_0$ under the alternative hypothesis, 
Hence, $T_{\rm stat}$ is expected to be less than or equal to 0 under $H_0$ and greater than 0 under $H_1$.
We then reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ if $T_{\rm stat}$ is greater than some threshold $q$.

Such decision rule may lead to two kinds of error:

   * The **type I error** is the incorrect rejection of null hypothesis when it is true,
   * The **type II error** is the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
    
The type I error rate or *significance level* is therefore the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true. 

In our case, for a given significance level $\alpha$, we will reject $H_0$ if $T_{\rm stat} > qt_{1-\alpha,n-1}$, where $qt_{1-\alpha,n-1}$ is the quantile of order $1-\alpha$ for a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

Indeed, by definition,

$$ \begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(\text{reject } H_0 \ | \ H_0 \ \text{true}) &= \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} > qt_{1-\alpha,n-1} \ | \ \mu \leq \mu_0) \\
& \leq \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} > qt_{1-\alpha,n-1} \ | \ \mu = \mu_0) \\
& \leq \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} > qt_{1-\alpha,n-1}) \\
& \leq \alpha
\end{aligned} $$

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
x_mean <- mean(x)
x_sd <- sd(x)
n <- length(x)
df <- n - 1
t.stat <- sqrt(n)*(x_mean-mu0)/x_sd
c(t.stat,qt(1-alpha, df))
```
We therefore don't reject $H_0$ in our example since $T_{\rm stat} < qt_{1-\alpha,n-1}$.

We can equivalently compute the significance level for which the test becomes significant.
This value is called the *p-value*:
$$\begin{aligned}
p_{\rm value} & = \max\mathbb{P}_{H_0}(T_{\rm stat} > T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}) \\
& = \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} > T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}  \ | \ \mu=\mu_0) \\
&= 1 - \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \leq T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs})
\end{aligned}$$

Now, $T_{\rm stat} > qt_{1-\alpha,n-1}$ under $H_0$ if and only if $\mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \leq T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}) \geq 1-\alpha$.
Then, the test is significant at the level $\alpha$ if and only if $p_{\rm value}\leq \alpha$.

```{r}
p.value <- 1 - pt(t.stat,df) 
print(p.value)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p172 <- p.value
```

Here, we would reject $H_0$ for any significance level $\alpha \geq$ `r round(p172,3)`.

**Important:** The fact that the test is not significant at the level $\alpha$ does not allow us to conclude that $H_0$ is true, i.e. that $\mu$ is less than or equal to 500. We can only say that the data does not allow us to conclude that $\mu>500$. 


Imagine now that we want to test if $\mu \geq 515$ for instance. The alternative here is $H_1: \ ``\mu < 515"$.

```{r}
mu0 <- 515
t.test(x, alternative = "less", mu = mu0)
```

More generally, we may want to test
$$H_0: \ ``\mu \geq \mu_0" \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \ ``\mu < \mu_0" $$
We still use the statistic $T_{\rm stat} = \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}-\mu_0)/s$ for this test, but the rejection region is now the area that lies to the left of the critical value $qt_{\alpha,n-1}$ since

$$ \begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(\text{reject } H_0 \ | \ H_0 \ \text{true}) &= \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} < qt_{\alpha,n-1} \ | \ \mu \geq \mu_0) \\
& \leq \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} < qt_{\alpha,n-1} \ | \ \mu = \mu_0) \\
& \leq \alpha
\end{aligned} $$


```{r}
t.stat <- sqrt(n)*(x_mean-mu0)/x_sd
p.value <- pt(t.stat,df)
c(t.stat, df, p.value)
```
Here, the p-value is less than $\alpha=0.05$: we then reject the null hypothesis at the $5\%$ level and conclude that $\mu < 515$.

### Two sided test

A two sided test (or two tailed test) can be used to test if $\mu=500$ for instance
  
```{r}
mu0 = 500
t.test(x, alternative = "two.sided", mu  =mu0)
```
 
 More generally, we can test
$$H_0: \ ``\mu = \mu_0" \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \ ``\mu \neq \mu_0" $$
The test also uses the statistic $T_{\rm stat} = \sqrt{n}(\bar{x}-\mu_0)/s$, but the rejection region has now two parts: we reject $H_0$ if $|T_{\rm stat}| > qt_{1-\alpha/2}$. Indeed,
 
 $$ \begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(\text{reject } H_0 \ | \ H_0 \ \text{true}) &= \mathbb{P}(|T_{\rm stat}| > qt_{1 -\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \ | \ \mu = \mu_0) \\
& = \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} < qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \ | \ \mu = \mu_0) +
 \mathbb{P}(T_{\rm stat} > qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \ | \ \mu = \mu_0)\\
&= \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \leq qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}) +  \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \geq qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}) \\
 &= \frac{\alpha}{2} + \frac{\alpha}{2} \\
& = \alpha
\end{aligned} $$

 
 The p-value of the test is now
 $$\begin{aligned}
p_{\rm value} & = \mathbb{P}_{H_0}(|T_{\rm stat}| > |T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|) \\
& = \mathbb{P}_{H_0}(T_{\rm stat} < -|T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|)  + \mathbb{P}_{H_0}(T_{\rm stat} > |T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|)\\
&= \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \leq -|T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|) +  \mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \geq |T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|) \\
&= 2 \,\mathbb{P}(t_{n-1} \leq -|T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|)
\end{aligned}$$
 
 
```{r}
t.stat <- sqrt(n)*(x_mean-mu0)/x_sd
p.value <- 2*pt(-abs(t.stat),df) 
c(t.stat, df, p.value)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
p246 <- p.value
```

Here, $p_{\rm value}=$ `r round(p246,3)`. Then, for any significance level less than `r round(p246,3)`, we cannot reject the hypothesis that $\mu = 500$.

### Confidence interval for the mean

We have just seen that the data doesn't allow us to reject the hypothesis that $\mu = 500$. But we would come to the same conclusion with other values of $\mu_0$. In particular, we will never reject the hypothesis that $\mu = \bar{x}$:

```{r}
t.test(x, mu=x_mean, conf.level = 1 - alpha)$p.value
```
For a given significance level ($\alpha = 0.05$ for instance), we will not reject the null hypothesis for values of $\mu_0$ close enough to $\bar{x}$.
  
```{r}
pv.510 <- t.test(x, mu = 510, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
pv.497 <- t.test(x, mu = 497, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
c(pv.510, pv.497)
```

On the other hand, we will reject $H_0$ for values of $\mu_0$ far enough from $\bar{x}$:

```{r}
pv.520 <- t.test(x, mu = 520, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
pv.490 <- t.test(x, mu = 490, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
c(pv.520, pv.490)
```

There exist two values of $\mu_0$ for which the decision is borderline
  
```{r}
pv1 <- t.test(x, mu = 496.47, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
pv2 <- t.test(x, mu = 515.97, conf.level = 1-alpha)$p.value
c(pv1,pv2)
```

In fact, for a given $\alpha$,  these two values $\mu_{\alpha,{\rm lower}}$ and  $\mu_{\alpha,{\rm upper}}$ define a *confidence interval* for $\mu$: We are ``confident'' at the level $1-\alpha$ that any value between $\mu_{\alpha,{\rm lower}}$ and  $\mu_{\alpha,{\rm upper}}$ is a possible value for $\mu$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
mu     <- seq(490, 520, by = 0.25)
t_stat <- (x_mean - mu) / x_sd * sqrt(n)
pval   <- pmin(pt(-t_stat, df) + (1 - pt(t_stat, df)),
               pt(t_stat, df) + (1 - pt(-t_stat, df)))
CI     <- x_mean + x_sd/sqrt(n) * qt(c(alpha/2, 1-alpha/2), df)
data.frame(mu = mu, p.value = pval) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = mu, y = p.value)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = x_mean, colour="red", linetype=2)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = alpha, colour="green", linetype=2)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = CI, colour="red") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(c(490,500,510,520,CI,x_mean),2)) 
```

By construction,

$$\begin{aligned}
1-\alpha &=  \mathbb{P}\left(qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} < \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} < qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \right) \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(\bar{x} +\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} < \mu < \bar{x} +\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \right) 
\end{aligned}$$

The confidence interval of level $1-\alpha$ for $\mu$ is therefore the interval
$${\rm CI}_{1-\alpha} = \left[\bar{x} +\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1} \ \ , \ \ 
\bar{x} +\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n-1}\right] $$

```{r}
(CI <- x_mean + x_sd / sqrt(n) * qt(c(alpha/2, 1-alpha/2), df))
```

::: {.remark}

The fact that $\mathbb{P}( \mu \in {\rm CI}_{1-\alpha}) = 1- \alpha$ does not mean that $\mu$ is a random variable! It is the bounds of the confidence interval that  are random because they are function of the data.
  
A confidence interval of level $1-\alpha$ should be interpreted like this: imagine that we repeat  the same experiment many times, with the same experimental conditions, and that we build a confidence interval for $\mu$ for each of these replicate. Then, the true mean $\mu$ will lie in the confidence interval  $(1-\alpha)100\%$ of the times.

Let us check this property with a Monte Carlo simulation. 

```{r}
n_replicate <- 1e5
n <- 100; mu <- 500; sd <- 40
R <- replicate(n_replicate, {
  x  <- rnorm(n, mu, sd)
  ci <- mean(x) + sd(x)/sqrt(n)*qt(c(alpha/2, 1-alpha/2), n-1)
  (mu > ci[1] & mu < ci[2])
})
mean(R)
```

:::


::: {.remark}

The decision rule to reject or not the null hypothesis can be derived from the confidence interval. Indeed, the confidence interval plays the role of an acceptance region:  we reject $H_0$ if $\mu_0$ does not belong to ${\rm CI}_{1-\alpha}$.

In the case of a one sided test, the output of `t.test` called confidence interval is indeed an acceptance region for $\mu$, but not a "confidence interval" (we cannot seriously consider that $\mu$ can take any value above 500 for instance \ldots)

```{r}
rbind(
c(x_mean + x_sd/sqrt(n)*qt(alpha,df) , Inf),
c(-Inf, x_mean + x_sd/sqrt(n)*qt(1-alpha,df)))
```

## Two samples t-test

### What should we test?

Let us now compare the weights of the male and female rats.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
rat_weight %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(x = gender, y = weight) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = gender)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +  ylab("weight (g)")
```

Looking at the data is more than enough for concluding that the mean weight of the males is (much) larger than the mean weight of the females \ldots Computing a $p$-value here is of little interest \ldots

```{r}
rat_weight %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarize(average_weight = mean(weight)) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
x <- rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% pull("weight")
y <- rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Female") %>% pull("weight")
t.test(x, y)
```

Let us see now what happens if we compare the control and GMO groups for the male rats.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot() + aes(x = regime, y = weight) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = regime)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +  ylab("weight (g)")
x <- rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male" & regime == "Control") %>% pull("weight")
y <- rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male" & regime == "GMO") %>% pull("weight")
```


We observe a difference between the two empirical means (the mean weight after 14 weeks is greater in the control group), but we cannot say how significant this difference is by simply looking at the data. Performing a statistical test is now necessary.

Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n_x}$ be the weights of the $n_x$ male rats of the control group and $y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n_x}$ the weights of the $n_y$ male rats of the GMO group. We will assume normal distributions for both $(x_{i})$ and $(y_{i})$:

$$ x_{i} \sim^{\mathrm{iid}} \mathcal{N}(\mu_x \ , \ \sigma^2_x) \quad ; \quad y_{i} \sim^{\mathrm{iid}} \mathcal{N}(\mu_y \ , \ \sigma^2_y)$$

We want to test 

$$H_0: \ ``\mu_x = \mu_y" \quad \text{versus} \quad H_1: \ ``\mu_x \neq \mu_y" $$

### Assuming equal variances

We can use the function `t.test` assuming first equal variances ($\sigma^2_x=\sigma_y^2$)

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
t.test(x, y, conf.level = 1-alpha, var.equal = TRUE)
```

The test statistic is

$$T_{\rm stat} = \frac{\bar{x} - \bar{y}}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_x}+\frac{1}{n_y}}}  $$
where $s_p^2$ is the *pooled variance*:

$$s_p^2 = \frac{1}{n_x+n_y-2} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n_x} (x_{i}-\bar{x})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n_y} (y_{i}-\bar{y})^2 \right)  $$

Under the null hypothesis, $T_{\rm stat}$ follows a $t$-distribution with $n_x+n_y-2$ degree of freedom. The $p$-value is therefore

$$\begin{aligned}
p_{\rm value} & = \mathbb{P}_{H_0}(|T_{\rm stat}| > |T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}|) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(t_{n_x+n_y-2} \leq -T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs}) + 1 - \mathbb{P}(t_{n_x+n_y-2} \leq T_{\rm stat}^{\rm obs})
\end{aligned}$$

```{r}
nx <- length(x)
ny <- length(y)
x_mean <- mean(x)
y_mean <- mean(y)
x_sc <- sum((x-x_mean)^2)
y_sc <- sum((y-y_mean)^2)
xy_sd <- sqrt((x_sc+y_sc)/(nx+ny-2))
t.stat <- (x_mean-y_mean)/xy_sd/sqrt(1/nx+1/ny)
df <- nx + ny -2
p.value <- pt(-t.stat, df) + (1- pt(t.stat, df))
c(t.stat, df, p.value)
```

The confidence interval for the mean difference $\mu_x-\mu_y$ is computed as
$${\rm CI}_{1-\alpha} = [\bar{x} - \bar{y} +s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_x}+\frac{1}{n_y}}qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},n_x+n_y-2} \ \ , \ \ 
\bar{x} - \bar{y} +s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_x}+\frac{1}{n_y}}qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},n_x+n_y-2} ] $$


```{r}
x_mean - y_mean  + xy_sd*sqrt(1/nx+1/ny)*qt(c(alpha/2,1-alpha/2), df)
```

### Assuming different variances

Assuming equal variances for the two groups may be disputable.

```{r}
rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% 
  group_by(regime) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(weight), sd = sd(weight))
```

We can then use the `t.test` function with different variances (which is the default)

```{r}
t.test(x, y, conf.level = 1-alpha)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df464 <- length(x) + length(y)-2
```

The Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used instead of $n_x+n_y-2=$ `r df464`:

$$\mathrm{df}_W = \frac{(c_x + c_y)^2}{{c_x^2}/{(n_x-1)} + {c_y^2}/{(n_y-1)}}$$
where $c_x = \sum (x_{i}-\bar{x})^2/(n_x(n_x-1))$ and $c_y = \sum (y_{i}-\bar{y})^2/(n_y(n_y-1))$.

Furthermore, unlike in Student's t-test with equal variances, the denominator is not based on a pooled variance estimate:

$$T_{\rm stat} = \frac{\bar{x} - \bar{y}}{ \sqrt{{s_x^2}/{n_x}+{s_y^2}/{n_y}}}  $$
where $s_x^2$ and $s_y^2$ are the empirical variances of $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$:
$$ s_x^2 = \frac{1}{n_x-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n_x} (x_{i}-\bar{x})^2  \quad ; \quad
s_y^2 = \frac{1}{n_y-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n_y} (y_{i}-\bar{y})^2$$

```{r}
sbar.xy <- sqrt(var(x)/nx+var(y)/ny)
t.stat <- (x_mean-y_mean)/sbar.xy
cx <- x_sc/(nx-1)/nx
cy <- y_sc/(ny-1)/ny
dfw <- (cx + cy)^2 / (cx^2/(nx-1) + cy^2/(ny-1))
p.value <- pt(-t.stat,dfw) + (1- pt(t.stat,dfw))
c(t.stat, dfw, p.value)
```

The confidence interval for  $\mu_x-\mu_y$ is now computed as

$${\rm CI}_{1-\alpha} = [\bar{x} - \bar{y} +\sqrt{\frac{s_x^2}{n_x}+\frac{s_y^2}{n_y}} \ qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}_W} \ \ , \ \ 
\bar{x} - \bar{y} +\sqrt{\frac{s_x^2}{n_x}+\frac{s_y^2}{n_y}} \ qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}_W} ] $$


```{r}
x_mean-y_mean  + sbar.xy*qt(c(alpha/2,1-alpha/2),dfw)
```

# Wilcoxon test

The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test, can be used to test if the weight in one of the two groups tends to be greater than in the other group.

The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is a *non parametric test*: we don't make the assumption that the distribution of the data belongs to a family of parametric ditributions.

The logic behind the Wilcoxon test is quite simple. The data are ranked to
produce two rank totals, one for each group. If there is a systematic difference
between the two groups, then most of the high ranks will belong to one group
and most of the low ranks will belong to the other one. As a result, the rank totals will
be quite different and one of the rank totals will be quite small. On the other hand, if
the two groups are similar, then high and low ranks will be distributed fairly
evenly between the two groups and the rank totals will be fairly similar.

In our example, we don't clearly see any of the two groups on the right or on the left of the scatter plot

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=8}
rat_weight %>% filter(gender == "Male") %>% 
ggplot() +  geom_point(aes(x = weight, y = as.numeric(as.factor(regime)), colour=regime)) +
  ylab(NULL) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL, limits=c(-6,9)) + xlab("weight (g)")
```

We can check that the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is not significant (at the level 0.05)

```{r, warning = FALSE}
wilcox.test(x, y, alternative="two.sided", conf.level=1-alpha)
```

The test statistic $W_x$ is computed a follows:

   * Assign numeric ranks to all the observations, beginning with 1 for the smallest value. Where there are groups of tied values, assign a rank equal to the midpoint of unadjusted rankings
   * define $R_x$ (resp. $R_y$) as the sum of the ranks for the observations which came from sample $x$ (resp. $y$)
   * Let   $W_x = R_x - {n_x(n_x+1)}/{2}$ and $W_y = R_y - {n_y(n_y+1)}/{2}$

```{r}
nx <- length(x)
ny <- length(y)
Wx <- sum(rank(c(x,y))[1:nx]) - nx*(nx+1)/2
Wy <- sum(rank(c(y,x))[1:ny]) - ny*(ny+1)/2
c(Wx, Wy)
```

For a two sided tests and assuming that $W_x^{\rm obs}>W_y^{\rm obs}$, the $p$-value is 
$$ p_{\rm value} =  \mathbb{P}(W_y \leq W_y^{\rm obs}) + \mathbb{P}(W_x \geq W_x^{\rm obs})$$
The distribution of $W_x$ and $W_y$ are tabulated and this $p$-value can then be computed

```{r}
pwilcox(Wy,ny,nx) + 1 - pwilcox(Wx,nx,ny)
```


We could of course exchange the roles of $x$ and $y$. In this case the test statistic would be
$W_y$ but the p-value would be the same.

Unlike the t-test, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon does not require the assumption of normal distributions. However, it is nearly as efficient as the t-test on normal distributions. That means that both tests have similar power.

This important property can easily be checked by Monte Carlo simulation. Let us simulate $L$ replicates of the experiments under $H_1$, assuming that $\mu_y=\mu_x +15$. We can then compare the power of both tests by comparing the rejection rates of the null hypothesis.

```{r}
n_replicate <- 10000
alpha <- 0.05
mu_x <- 500; mu_y <- 520
sd_x <- sd_y <- 30
n_x <- n_y <- 40
replicate(n_replicate, {
  x_new <- rnorm(nx, mu_x, sd_x)
  y_new <- rnorm(ny, mu_y, sd_y)
  c(Student  = t.test(x_new, y_new)$p.value < alpha,
    Wilcoxon = wilcox.test(x_new, y_new)$p.value < alpha)
}) %>% rowMeans()
```

On the other hand, the Wilcoxon test may be much more powerful than the t-test for non normal distributions when the empirical mean converges slowly in distribution to the normal distribution. Such is the case, for instance, of the log-normal ditribution which is strongly skewed for large variances.

```{r}
mu_x <- 5; mu_y <- 6
sd_x <- sd_y <- 1
n_x <- n_y <- 20
replicate(n_replicate, {
  x_new <- exp(rnorm(n_x, mu_x, sd_x))
  y_new <- exp(rnorm(n_y, mu_y, sd_y))
  c(Student  = t.test(x_new, y_new, alternative="two.sided")$p.value < alpha,
    Wilcoxon = wilcox.test(x_new, y_new, alternative="two.sided")$p.value < alpha)
}) %>% rowMeans()
```

# The limited role of the p-value 

First of all it is important to emphasis that statistics is a tool for supporting decision-making. It is not a decision tool that can be used blindly.

A $p$-value below the sacrosanct 0.05 threshold does not mean that GMOs have some negative impacts on human health, or that a drug is better than another one. On the other hand, a $p$-value above 0.05 does not mean that GMOs are safe or that a drug has no effect. 


The American Statistical Association (ASA) has released a ["Statement on Statistical Significance
and P-Values"](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108) with six principles underlying the proper use and interpretation of the p-value. 

"The p-value was never intended to be a substitute for scientific reasoning," said Ron
Wasserstein, the ASA's executive director. "Well-reasoned statistical arguments contain much
more than the value of a single number and whether that number exceeds an arbitrary
threshold. The ASA statement is intended to steer research into a 'post p<0.05 era.'"
"Over time it appears the p-value has become a gatekeeper for whether work is publishable, at
least in some fields," said Jessica Utts, ASA president. "This apparent editorial bias leads to the
'file-drawer effect,' in which research with statistically significant outcomes are much more
likely to get published, while other work that might well be just as important scientifically is
never seen in print. It also leads to practices called by such names as 'p-hacking' and 'data
dredging' that emphasize the search for small p-values over other statistical and scientific
reasoning."

The statement's six principles, many of which address misconceptions and misuse of the p-value,
are the following:

   1. P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.
   2. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the
probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
   3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on
whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.
   4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.
   5. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the
importance of a result.
   6. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or
hypothesis.


As an illustration, assume that the diet has a real impact on the weight: after 14 weeks, rats fed with GMOs weigh in average 15g less than control rats. 

It will be extremly unlikely to conclude that there is an effect with only 10 rats per group, even if we observe a difference of 15g in the two samples.

```{r}
n <- 10
mu <- 500
delta <- 15
sd <- 30
x.sim <- rnorm(n,mu,sd)
y.sim <- x.sim + delta
t.test(x.sim, y.sim)
```
This basic example shows that a difference considered as biologically significant may not be statistically significant.

On the other hand, a small difference considered as not biologically significant (1g for instance) may be considered as 
statistically significant if the group sizes are large enough.

```{r}
n <- 10000
delta <- 1
x.sim <- rnorm(n,mu,sd)
y.sim <- x.sim + delta
t.test(x.sim, y.sim)
```

This example confirms the need for a power analysis as a complement of the comparison test. We will see that equivalence testing may also be relevant for evaluating what the data allows to say. 

## Power of a t-test

Until now, we have demonstrated that the experimental data does not highlight any significant difference in weight between the control group and the GMO group.

Of course, that does not mean that there is no difference between the two groups. Indeed, **absence of evidence is not evidence of absence**. In fact, no experimental study would be able to demonstrate the absence of effect of the diet on the weight. 

Now, the appropriate question is rather to evaluate what the experimental study can detect.
If feeding a population of rats with GMOs has a signicant biological effect on the weight, can we ensure with a reasonable level of confidence that our statistical test will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is indeed a difference in weight between the two groups?

A *power analysis* allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. Conversely, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints.

For a given  $\delta \in {\mathbb R}$, let $\beta(\delta)$ be the type II error rate, i.e. the probability to fail rejecting $H_0$ when $\mu_x-\mu_y = \delta$, with $\delta\neq 0$.


The power of the test is the probability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. It is also a function of $\delta =\mu_x-\mu_y$ defined as

$$ \begin{aligned}
\eta(\delta) &= 1 - \beta(\delta) \\
&= \mathbb{P}(\text{reject } H_0 \ | \ \mu_x-\mu_y=\delta )
\end{aligned} $$

Remember that, for a two sided test,  we reject the null hypothesis when  $|T_{\rm stat}| > qt_{1-\alpha/2, \mathrm{df}}$, where $\mathrm{df}$ is the appropriate degree of freedom.

On the other hand, ${(\bar{x} - \bar{y} - \delta)}/{s_{xy}}$, where $s_{xy} = \sqrt{{s_x^2}/{n_x}+{s_y^2}/{n_y}}$, follows a $t$-distribution with $\mathrm{df}$ degrees of freedom.
Thus,

$$ \begin{aligned}
\eta(\delta) &= 1 - \mathbb{P}\left(qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} < T_{\rm stat} < qt_{1 -\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} \ | \ \mu_x-\mu_y=\delta\right) \\
& = 1- \mathbb{P}\left(qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} < \frac{\bar{x} - \bar{y}}{s_{xy}} < qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} \ | \ \mu_x-\mu_y=\delta\right) \\
&= 1- \mathbb{P}\left(qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} - \frac{\delta}{s_{xy}} < \frac{\bar{x} - \bar{y} - \delta}{s_{xy}} < qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} - \frac{\delta}{s_{xy}} \ | \ \mu_x-\mu_y=\delta\right) \\
&= 1 - Ft_{\mathrm{df}}\left(qt_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} - \frac{\delta}{s_{xy}}\right) + Ft_{\mathrm{df}}\left(qt_{\frac{\alpha}{2},\mathrm{df}} - \frac{\delta}{s_{xy}}\right)
\end{aligned} $$


As an example, let us compute the probability to detect a difference in weight of 10g with two groups of 80 rats each and assuming that the standard deviation is 30g in each group.


```{r}
alpha=0.05
nx_new <- ny_new <- 80
delta_mu <- 10
x_sd <- 30
df <- nx_new + ny_new-2
dt <- delta_mu/x_sd/sqrt(1/nx_new+1/ny_new)
1-pt(qt(1-alpha/2,df)-dt,df) + pt(qt(alpha/2,df)-dt,df) 
```

The function `pwr.t.test` allows to compute this power:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pwr.t.test(n = nx_new, d = delta_mu/x_sd, type = "two.sample",
           alternative="two.sided", sig.level = alpha)
```

Let us perform a Monte Carlo simulation, to check this result and better understand what it means. Imagine that the "true" difference in weight is $\delta=10$g. Then, if could repeat the same experiment a (very) large number of times, we would reject the null hypothesis in $55\%$ of cases.

```{r}
n_replicate <- 1e5
mu_x <- 500
mu_y <- mu_x + delta_mu
R <- replicate(n_replicate, {
  x_new <- rnorm(nx_new, mu_x, x_sd)
  y_new <- rnorm(ny_new, mu_y, x_sd)
  t.test(x_new, y_new, alternative="two.sided")$p.value < alpha
})
mean(R)
```

We may consider this probability as too small. If our objective is a power of 80% at least, with the same significance level, we need to increase the sample size.

```{r}
pwr.t.test(power = 0.8, d = delta_mu/x_sd, sig.level=alpha) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pwn <- ceiling(pwr.t.test(power=0.8, d = delta_mu/x_sd, sig.level=alpha)$n)
```

Indeed, we see that $n\geq$ `r pwn` animals per group are required in order to reach a power of 80%.

```{r}
nx_new <- ny_new <- ceiling(pwr.t.test(power=0.8, d = delta_mu/x_sd, sig.level=alpha)$n)
df <- nx_new + ny_new - 2
dt <- delta_mu/x_sd/sqrt(1/nx_new + 1/ny_new)
1-pt(qt(1-alpha/2,df)-dt,df) + pt(qt(alpha/2,df)-dt,df)
```

An alternative for increasing the power consists in increasing the type I error rate

```{r}
pwr.t.test(power=0.8, d=delta_mu/x_sd, n = 80, sig.level = NULL) 
```

If we accept a significance level of about 20%, then we will be less demanding for rejecting $H_0$: we will reject the null hypothesis when $|T_{\rm stat}|>qt_{0.9,158}$=  `r round(qt(0.9,158),2)`, instead of $|T_{\rm stat}|>qt_{0.975,158}$=  `r round(qt(0.975,158),2)`. This strategy will therefore increase the power, but also the type I error rate.
