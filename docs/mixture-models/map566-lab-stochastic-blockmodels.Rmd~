##  Introduction

This tutorial introduces the graph clustering techniques seen during the lectures, that is,

- Spectral methods, mainly spectral clustering and its variants
- Model-based approaches, namely, stochastic blocmodels (binary, weigthed, bipartite, w/o covariates)

These methods will be illustrated for the analysis of an (ecological) network data set.

###  Requirements

The packages required for the analysis are `sbm` and `igraph` (`sbm` @sbm-package is based on the package `blockmodels` @blockmodels), plus some others for data manipulation and representation. 

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(igraph)    # graph manipulation
library(sbm)       # stochastic bloc model
library(tidyverse) # data manipulation
library(aricode)   # clustering measures comparison
```

## Advice

*Use the documentation of the aforementioned packages!!*, and the vignettes available at [https://grosssbm.github.io/sbm/](https://grosssbm.github.io/sbm/)

:::

Some extra packages can be obtained for fancier representations, 

```{r additional packages}
#| code-fold: true
library(corrplot)  # plot of covariance/correlation matrices
library(ggraph)
library(RColorBrewer)
theme_set(theme_bw())

fancy_network <- function(mygraph, group) {

  V(mygraph)$party  <- as.character(group)
  V(mygraph)$degree <- degree(mygraph)

  angle <- 90 - 360 * 1:igraph::gorder(mygraph) / igraph::gorder(mygraph)
  V(mygraph)$hjust <- ifelse(angle < -90, 1, 0)
  V(mygraph)$angle <- ifelse(angle < -90, angle + 180, angle)
  
  p <- ggraph(mygraph, layout = 'linear', circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_edge_arc(alpha = 0.25, show.legend = FALSE) +
#    geom_node_text(aes(label = party, x = x*1.05, y=y*1.05, angle = angle, hjust = hjust), size = 3) +
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = party, size = degree), alpha = 0.5) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c(brewer.pal(6,"Paired"),"maroon4","springgreen", "tan4","plum","brown4","burlywood",brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"), "navy")) +
    theme_graph(base_size = 20)
  
  invisible(p)
}
```
 

### Data set: antagonistic tree/fungus interaction network

![Fungus on tree](resources/Tree-Fungus.jpg){width=150px} 

We consider the fungus-tree interaction network studied by @tree_fungus_network, available with the package **sbm**:

```{r import dataset}
data("fungusTreeNetwork")
str(fungusTreeNetwork,  max.level = 1)
```

This data set provides information about $154$ fungi sampled on $51$ tree species. It is a list with the following entries:

- `tree_names` : list of the tree species names
- `fungus_names`: list of the fungus species names
- `tree_tree` : weighted tree-tree interactions (number of common fungal species two tree species host)
- `fungus_tree` : binary fungus-tree interactions
- `covar_tree` : covariates associated to pairs of trees (namely genetic, taxonomic and geographic distances)

During this tutorial we are going to explore successive variants of the Stochastic Blockmodels to analyse binary, weighted, then bipartite network, also by introducing external information via covariates.

## Analysis of the tree/tree data

The tree-tree interactions result into a simple network.

### Tree-tree binary interaction networks

We first consider the binary network where an edge is drawn between two trees when they do share a least one common fungi. Eventually, we will assume that our matrix is the realization of the SBM: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
 (Z_i) \text{ i.i.d.} \qquad & Z_i \sim \mathcal{M}(1, \alpha) \\
 (Y_{ij}) \text{ indep.} \mid (Z_i) \qquad & (Y_{ij} \mid Z_i=k, Z_j = \ell) \sim \mathcal{B}(\pi_{k\ell})
\end{aligned}
$$

**Questions**

1. Extract the binary tree-tree adjacency matrix and plot it (`plotMyMatrix`)
2. Plot the adjacency matrix. Construct and build an igraph object to plot the network 
3. Implement different variant of spectral clustering and test them on this data. Plot the corresponding reordered adjacency matrix.
4. Adjust a simple binary SBM with `estimateSimpleSBM`. Become familiar with object `simpleSBM`.
5. Select a model via ICL. Explore/check models with similar ICL (using `$setModel()`, `$storedModel`)

### Weighted interaction network with Poisson model

Instead of considering the binary network tree-tree we may consider the weighted network where the link between two trees is the number of fungi they share.

$$
\begin{aligned}
 (Z_i) \text{ i.i.d.} \qquad & Z_i \sim \mathcal{M}(1, \pi) \\
 (Y_{ij}) \text{ indep.} \mid (Z_i) \qquad & (Y_{ij} \mid Z_i=k, Z_j = \ell) \sim \mathcal{P}(\exp(\alpha_{kl})) = \mathcal{P}(\lambda_{kl})
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Adjust a collection of Poisson SBM, explore the models.
2. Compare spectral, binary SBM and Poisson SBM with ARI/NID (package `aricode`) and alluvial plots (`plotAlluvial`)

### Including covariate effects

We have on each pair of trees 3 covariates, namely the genetic distance, the taxonomic
distance and the geographic distance.

Each covariate has to be introduced as a  matrix: $X^k_{ij}$ corresponds to the value of the $k$-th covariate describing the couple $(i,j)$.

$$
Z_i \sim^{\text{iid}} \mathcal{M}(1, \alpha) \\
Y_{ij} \mid Z_i=k, Z_j = \ell \sim \mathcal{P}(\exp(\pi_{kl} + x_{ij}^\intercal \theta)) = \mathcal{P}(\gamma_{kl}\exp(x_{ij}^\top \theta))
$$

**Questions**

1. Plot the data matrix of covariates
2. Use k-means or hierarchical clustering to cluster the covariates data, and compare with the previous graph clustering obtained
3. Adjust a Poisson SBM with covariates (1, 2, all of them).
4. Compare the obtained clustering with ARI/NID and alluvial plots
5. Use ICL to select the "best" model among all the Poisson models.

## Analysis of the tree/fungi data with Bipartite SBM

We now consider the tree-fungi interaction network.

$$
Z^R_i \sim^{\text{iid}} \mathcal{M}(1, \alpha^R) \\
Z^C_i \sim^{\text{iid}} \mathcal{M}(1, \alpha^C) \\
Y_{ij} \mid Z^R_i=k, Z^C_j = \ell \sim \mathcal{f}(\gamma_{k\ell}, x_{ij}^\top \theta)
$$

Redo the whole analysis, using this time a bipartite SBM.
